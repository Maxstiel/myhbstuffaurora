			<h4>QUORI NAMES</h4>
			<p>Quori names tend to be monosyllabics and feature hard, rough and hissing consonants. Quoris do not have last names, and their names might be duplicated over the course of years and creation.</p>
			<span class="feature">Names:</span> Khad, Tari, Meri, Melk, Vakri, Hareth, Ishara, Ashana, Ashtai, Atash.
			</p>
			<h4>QUORI TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your Quori character shares the following traits with all other Quoris.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Being spirits, dreams and not humanoids, Quoris are usually born adult and do not age. However, they are not immortal. If they die anywhere other than on Dal Quor, they do not regenerate and stay dead.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Children of Quor Tarai, the Quoris tend to follow him, their creator, also named Il-Lashtavar or the Darkness that Dreams. They tend to be evil, or at the very least chaotic. However, some Quoris (such as the ones merging with humanoids to create the kalashtars) might be neutral.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium. To be able to enter the material plane, your Quori character had to merge with an humanoid. While they are not the humanoid itself, they share their size and weight.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Steel Mind.</em></strong> Dreams, Quoris have a mind of steel and are not as easily hurt by psychic shenanigans. You have resistance to psychic damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Mind Link.</em></strong> Monstrosities that used to get in everyone's head, you did not lose this ability when merging with the humanoid. You can speak telepathically to creatures in 30ft of you, but they can not talk back and need to understand at least one of your languages to understand you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Psychic Sight.</em></strong> Creatures of lies, Quoris tend to know easily when people are attempting to lie to them. You gain proficiency in the Insight skill.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Merged Creature.</em></strong> You might have merged with a humanoid, your monstrous side took over and the humanoid soul that once was in your body got destroyed. Your creature type is Aberration.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Quori.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> You are part of one of the subraces of Quoris who might have left Dal Quor. Choose between Tsucora, Hashalaq or Kastheovnal.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Hashalaq, or "dreamstealer" quori are the judges and intellectuals of Dal Quor. Those hashalaq who don't use Inspired to exist on the Material Plane spend their days studying Eberron and the Orrery of the planes. In the power structures of Dal Quor, they frequently serve as advisors to higher ranking Kalaraq Quori. In their role as judges, they are charged with keeping the schemes of lesser quori from disrupting the grand ambitions of Il-Lashtavar. They are masters of history, arcana, insight, and persuasion. The hashalaq are unique amongst quori in that they understand magic rather than purely using psionics.</p>
